Nodemon
=======
-Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
-Nodemon can be installed using NPM.
 ex:- npm i -g nodemon
-Nodemon can be used without installing also, using npx
 npx nodemon file1.js
-nodemon help
 nodemon -h 
 nodemon --help
-Just use nodemon instead of node to run your code, your process will automatically restart when your code changes
 ex:- node file1.js      (server won't be re-started when code is changed)
      nodemon file1.js   (server gets re-started when there is a code change)
	  npx nodemon file1.js   (server gets re-started when there is a code change)
-The 'node_modules' folder is ignored by default by nodemon.
-You can restart the process at any time by typing 'rs' and hitting enter.


NodeJs Modules
==============
-A way of encapsulating code in to separate logical units.
-Module:A set of functions you want to include in your application.
-In Node.js module system, each file is treated as a separate module.
-Node.js includes three types of modules:
	1. Core(Built-in) Modules     	  (os,fs,http,process,path,url)
	2. Local(Custom) Modules    	  (created locally in our application)
	3. Third Party(External) Modules  (can be installed using NPM, and can be used) ex:-minimist,express,mongoose,lodash,moment,chalk,cors,axios


Local(Custom) Modules 
=====================
-Node.js has two types of modules: 
	1. ES modules 
	2. CommonJS modules
-By default, Node.js treats JavaScript as CommonJS modules. But we can tell Node.js to treat JavaScript code as ES modules.
-Node.js will treat the following files as ES modules:
	a.Files ending in .mjs
	b.if "type": "module" is set in package.json


CommonJS
=========
module.exports = {}
require()


ESM
===
export (1. named export 2. default export)
import { add, sub, mul } from "./Math_Util_ES";

Note:
=====
-A module cannot have multiple default exports.
-default export cann't be used to export variables.
-Default exports can be imported with any name
-named exports has to be imported with the same name it is exported
