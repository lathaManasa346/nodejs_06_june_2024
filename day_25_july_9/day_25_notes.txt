userInfo()	Returns information about the current user
availableParallelism() 
constants	 Returns an object containing the operating system's constants for process signals, error cotes etc.



Node.js fs module
=================
-The fs module provides a lot of very useful functionality to access and interact with the file system.
-There is no need to install it. Being part of the Node.js core, it can be used by simply requiring it. and have access to all its methods.

ex: 
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile(fileName [,options], callback)	Reads existing file.
fs.writeFile(filename, data[, options], callback)	Writes to the file. If file exists then overwrite the content otherwise creates new file.
fs.open(path, flags[, mode], callback)	Opens file for reading or writing.
fs.rename(oldPath, newPath, callback)	Renames an existing file.
fs.chown(path, uid, gid, callback)	Asynchronous chown.
fs.stat(path, callback)	Returns fs.stat object which includes important file statistics.
fs.link(srcpath, dstpath, callback)	Links file asynchronously.
fs.unlink(path, callback);	Delete a file.
fs.symlink(destination, path[, type], callback)	Symlink asynchronously.
fs.rmdir(path, callback)	Renames an existing directory.
fs.mkdir(path[, mode], callback)	Creates a new directory.
fs.readdir(path, callback)	Reads the content of the specified directory.
fs.utimes(path, atime, mtime, callback)	Changes the timestamp of the file.
fs.exists(path, callback)	Determines whether the specified file exists or not.
fs.access(path[, mode], callback)	Tests a user's permissions for the specified file.
fs.appendFile(file, data[, options], callback)	Appends new content to the existing file.
