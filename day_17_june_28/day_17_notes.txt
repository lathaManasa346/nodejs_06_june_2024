Prototype
---------
-A prototype is an object used to implement structure, state, and behaviour inheritance.
-Prototype is the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another
-Prototype is an object, where we can attach methods and properties,which enables all the other objects to inherit these methods and properties.
-Prototype is a base class for all the objects, and it helps us to achieve inheritance.
-All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
-properties added to the prototype of a class gets available to all the objects of that class.
-prototype should be used When we have to add new properties like variables and methods 
at a later point of time,and these properties needs to be shared across all the instances, 
-a property should be added to the constructor of a class if value of the property changes per object
-a property should be added to the prototype of a class if the value remains same for all objects.


Object 
=======
Object class static functions : 
	assign() - Copies properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
	create() -  creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object
	freeze() - Freezes an object. neither the structure nor values can be changed
	isFrozen() - Determines if an object was frozen
	seal()  - structure of the object cann't be modified, value of the properties can be changed.
	isSealed() - Determines if an object is sealed.
	preventExtensions() -new properties cann't be added to an object, properties can be deleted, value of the properties can be changed
    isExtensible() - Determines if extending of an object is allowed
	keys()	- Returns an array of keys
	values() - Returns an array of values
	entries() - returns an array of [key, value] pairs
	fromEntries() - transforms an array/Map into an Object
