Function Curring
================
-Function Currying is a concept of breaking a function with many arguments into many functions with single argument in such a way, that the output is same. 
-its a technique of simplifying a multi-valued argument function into single-valued argument multi-functions.
-It helps to create a higher-order function. It is extremely helpful in event handling.

	var add = function (a){
                 return function(b){
                       return function(c){
                                 return a+b+c;
                              }        
                        }
                  }
	console.log(add(2)(3)(4)); //output 9


Pure Function
=============
-Pure functions are functions that accept an input and returns a value without 
 modifying any data outside its scope(Side Effects). 
 
-A function is called pure if that follows the below 3 standards
	1. Pure functions shouldn't update the data outside it's scope.
	2. pure functions must return a value.
	3. Its output or return value must depend on the input/arguments.
