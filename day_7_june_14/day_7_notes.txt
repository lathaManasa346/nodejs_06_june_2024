Function
=========
1. pre-defined / inbuilt 
   -The functions are already written, we just have to use them
   -console.log(), document.write()

2. user-defined
   -We have to write the function & use


a. Function Declaration (Named Function)
b. Function Expression  (Anonymous function)
c. self invoked   (Immediately Invoked function Expression)
d. Arrow Function (ES - 6   2015)


Function Declaration Vs Function Expression
============================================
1. Function Declaration - Named Function , Function Expression - Anonymous
2. Function Declaration can be invoked before the declaration statement - Hoisting
   Function Expression cannt be invoked before the declaration statement - Hoisting - No


Regular Function: (How 'this' works inside Regular Function)
this = How the function is called / From Where the function is called
this is dynamic, it changes 

Arrow Function: (How 'this' works inside Arrow Function)
this = where the function is declared
this value is static


Limitation of Arrow function
==============================
1. arrow functions should not be used as object methods.
2. don't use arrow functions, if 'this' value should be dynamic inside a function.
